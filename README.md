A react native redux implementation of our musical app

## Getting Started

This implementation uses npm, redux, react native and react native cli

Install npm using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
Install create-react-native-app [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

```
brew install node
npm install -g create-react-native-app
```

### Setup

```
cd Desktop (wherever you want to put it)
mkdir dvvy
cd dvvy
git clone https://github.com/barthinator/dvvy
cd dvvy
npm install (this will install all the dependecies)
```

### Overwiew

You can build the app using react native. The setup does not support expo currently.
